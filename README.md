# Pomodoro_Widget
This Pomodoro Widget is a simple, effective time management tool to help you boost your productivity while working or studying. Built with Python and Tkinter, it alternates work sessions with short and long breaks, encouraging focus and preventing burnout. The app features a minimalistic interface, customizable through the code, to keep you on track without distractions.

### Features
* Pomodoro Timer: Runs a default 25-minute work session timer, followed by short and long breaks.
* Customizable Times: Work, short break, and long break durations can be adjusted in the code.
* Session Counter: Displays checkmarks to indicate the number of completed work sessions.
* Minimalistic UI: A clean and distraction-free interface with basic control buttons (Start, Reset, Close).
* Always on Top: Ensures the timer stays on top of all other windows, keeping you focused.
* Auto-start: The next session starts automaticallyâ€”no need to manually start every work session or break.

### Getting Started
#### Prerequisites:
Before you run this app, make sure you have Python and Tkinter installed on your machine. Tkinter is included with Python from Python 3.1+, so there's no need for a separate installation for most users.

#### Usage
* Start Timer: Click on the "Start" button to begin the timer cycle.
* Reset Timer: Resets the timer and session counter. Use this to start a new cycle at any time.
* Close App: Click the "X" button to close the application.
  
#### Customization
To customize the timer durations, edit the following constants in the script:

* WORK_MIN: Length of a work session in minutes.
* SHORT_BREAK_MIN: Length of a short break in minutes.
* LONG_BREAK_MIN: Length of a long break in minutes.
